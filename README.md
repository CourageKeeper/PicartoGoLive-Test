# PicartoGoLive-Test
Test environment for a Discord bot in JS

This is a Discord Bot that utilizes the Picarto API to determine when /specified/ streamers are online and send
a notifcation to whichever servers the bot is attached to. Each server has a configuration file containing all of the
streamers that server wants to be notified by.
